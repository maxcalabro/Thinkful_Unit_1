1. Three longest trips on rainy days? (Had to look up the answer to find WITH/AS)

WITH rainy AS (
SELECT 
	Date
FROM
	weather
WHERE
	events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
	trip_id,
	duration,
	DATE(start_date) trip_date
FROM 
	trips
JOIN 
	rainy
ON 
	rainy.date = trip_date
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 3


2. Which station is empty most often?

SELECT 
	stations.name,
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	stations
JOIN
	status
ON
	stations.station_id = status.station_id
WHERE
	status.bikes_available = 0
GROUP BY
	stations.name
ORDER BY
	COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1


3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

SELECT 
	stations.name,
	stations.dockcount,
	COUNT(*) as 'number of trips'
FROM 
	stations
JOIN
	trips
ON
	stations.name = trips.start_station
GROUP BY 
	stations.name
ORDER BY
	stations.dockcount DESC


4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

WITH rainy AS (
SELECT 
	Date
FROM
	weather
WHERE
	events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT 
	rainy.Date,
	MAX(trips.duration)
FROM 
	rainy
JOIN
	trips
ON
	rainy.Date = DATE(trips.start_date)
GROUP BY 
	Date
