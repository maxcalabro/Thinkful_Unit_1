1. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

Two versions: Have two groups of people: people who take the supplement, people who don’t. 

Sample: Make sure the groups are large enough and randomly distributed.

Hypothesis: The new supplement helps people sleep better!

Outcomes: Key metric to measure: did people sleep better? Need to define this precisely. Is it based on hours of sleep? Self-reported sleep quality? An app that measures your sleep? Does that limit who can participate in the study?

Other Variables Measured: Did anything else change on the supplement besides sleep? Did it have side effects on appetite, mood, alertness, etc, etc, etc? 


2. Will new uniforms help a gym’s business? (For staff, I assume)

Two versions: If the gym has multiple locations, switch to the new uniforms at a subset of locations. If they only have one location, in order to maintain cohesiveness of the brand, it probably means switching to the new uniforms for several months, and then switching back if it’s not better. It probably makes more sense to just ask people if they like the new uniforms before going out and buying a whole bunch of them. Let’s assume there are multiple locations.

Sample: Some gyms stay with old uniforms, some switch to the new ones. It would be good to make these locations randomly distributed around the service area as much as possible, as different demographics may respond differently to the uniforms. 

Hypothesis: The new uniforms increase membership by 2%.

Outcomes: Key Metric: Did membership go up? Specifically, did it increase more or less than membership at other gyms, taking into account how membership was related between these two gyms before the switch. 

Other Variables Measured: Did anything else happen? More/less churn? Staff happier? Change in some other kind of sales?


3. Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?

Two versions: The old homepage and the new homepage. 

Sample: Randomly show some people the old one and some people the new one. Maybe by summing all the digits in their IP address, diverting every tenth visitor, etc.

Hypothesis: The new one is better! It converts more people to rent pets.

Outcomes: Key Metric: How much revenue does the website produce? Is the new one doing better than the old one? 

Other Variables Measured: What else happened? Did people stay on the website longer? Other intermediate variables that might be noticeable? If you have ads on the website, did your ad revenue change? How does the SEO compare?


4. If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

Two versions: The regular old email, and the new one with the PLEASE READ email subject.

Sample: Randomly selected email recipients. If you’re sending enough emails, this should be easy.

Hypothesis: You’ll have a high open rate for emails that say PLEASE READ. 

Outcomes: As phrased in the question, the key metric would be whether people have opened the email. Opening an email, however, doesn’t necessarily do much. Did click-through rate increase? 

Other Variables Measured: What else happened? Did people start unsubscribing because the emails are too annoying? If you’re selling something, did sales change for the new group?
