1. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

Two versions: Have two groups of people: people who take the supplement, people who don’t. 

Sample: Make sure the groups are large enough and randomly distributed.

Hypothesis: The new supplement increases the sleep time of participants by 10%. 

Outcomes: Key metric to measure: did people sleep more? How do we measure this accurately? Do we have an app that measures your sleep, or survey participants? Does that limit who can participate in the study, or the quality of the responses?

Other Variables Measured: Did anything else change on the supplement besides length of sleep? Did it have side effects on appetite, mood, alertness, etc, etc, etc? Did participants wake up more or less in the night? Did it take them less/more time to fall asleep?


2. Will new uniforms help a gym’s business? (For staff, I assume)

Two versions: If the gym has multiple locations, switch to the new uniforms at a subset of locations. If they only have one location, in order to maintain cohesiveness of the brand, it probably means switching to the new uniforms for several months, and then switching back if it’s not better. It probably makes more sense to just ask people if they like the new uniforms before going out and buying a whole bunch of them. Let’s assume there are multiple locations.

Sample: Some gyms stay with old uniforms, some switch to the new ones. It would be good to make these locations randomly distributed around the service area as much as possible, as different demographics may respond differently to the uniforms. 

Hypothesis: The new uniforms will increase profits by 5%.

Outcomes: Key Metric: Did profits go up for the gyms participating? 

Other Variables Measured: Did anything else happen? More/less churn? Staff happier? Change in some other kind of sales? What metrics drove the change in profits? More membership sign-ups? 


3. Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?

Two versions: The old homepage and the new homepage. 

Sample: Randomly show some people the old one and some people the new one. Maybe by summing all the digits in their IP address, diverting every tenth visitor, etc.

Hypothesis: The new website drives a 5% increase in profits.

Outcomes: Key Metric: How much revenue does the new website produce compared to the old one? Is this due exclusively to increased pet rentals? 

Other Variables Measured: What else happened? Did people stay on the website longer? Other intermediate variables that might be noticeable? If you have ads on the website, did your ad revenue change? How does the SEO compare?


4. If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

Two versions: The regular old email, and the new one with the PLEASE READ email subject.

Sample: Randomly selected email recipients. If you’re sending enough emails, this should be easy.

Hypothesis: Emails that say PLEASE READ will convert 10% more subscribers to buy something from the website. 

Outcomes: Did click-through rate increase, and did people purchase? 

Other Variables Measured: What else happened? Did people start unsubscribing because the emails are too annoying? Did email open rate change, and did that correspond to more clicks?
